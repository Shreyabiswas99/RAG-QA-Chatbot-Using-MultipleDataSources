# Advanced RAG Q&A Chatbot with multiple Data Sources using Langchain
* Inside this project, I have built a Q&A Chatbot using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique.
* Made use of multiple data sources as tools such as Arxiv, Wikipedia etc. You can include other tools as well.
* Next, I used Langchain agents to create and set my agents and agent executer.
* When we invoke the agent executer with a question, based on the question it decides which tool to use to answer that.
  
## Setup
* The entire program is run on jupyter notebook. You can also use VScode and open a virtual environment there.
* Downloading certain libraries by creating a requirements.txt file
